## Web Applications

I have a habit of creating web applications to provide a friendly interface to some of my other projects. The number of these apps has grown reliably over the last handful of years, you can find a list of them below.

| Application                                                                    | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Friends Oh My God](https://friends-omg.herokuapp.com/)                        | An extremely petty app in which I attempt to prove that they say "oh my god" a lot in the show "Friends".       |
| [SQLFluff Online Demo](https://sqlfluff-online.herokuapp.com/)                 | An online demonstration of the SQLFluff linter and formatter. Paste some SQL in to see what fluff thinks of it. |
| [Music Recommender](https://nolans-recommender.herokuapp.com/)                 | An Apriori-algorithm based music recommender. Search for an album you like to find recommendations.             |
| [Temperature in My Apartment](https://temp-in-nolans-apartment.herokuapp.com/) | View the current temperature of my apartment, collected once every minute on a raspberry pi.                    |
| [My Network Speed](https://nolans-network-speed.herokuapp.com/)                | View the speedtest.net results for my home network, collected every 15 minutes on a raspberry pi.               |

### Old Apps

These are some older applications that I am no longer collecting data to support.

| Application                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [How was the Q?](https://how-was-the-q.herokuapp.com/)        | View subjective Q-Train quality ratings, submitted by me in a Slack form every day after I arrive at work. I no longer take the Q so this project is dead. |
| [Dogwalker Checker](https://dogwalker-checker.herokuapp.com/) | Check up on when my dogwalker came. We switched services so this app is no longer needed.                                                                  |
