Title: About
Date: 2020-01-20

I live in New York City and work as a data scientist. I spend too much of my free time configuring Raspberry Pis.

Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student at Binghamton University. Here's a picture of me, on my honeymoon in Athens in 2017.
